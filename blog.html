      <h2>Mid-year Reflection on Database Management</h2>
      <p>
        The mid-term project provided a valuable opportunity to develop a library management system that combines theoretical knowledge with practical coding skills. The project required the creation of a virtual library system capable of managing book records, tracking availability, analyzing ratings, and assigning books to groups of students. While the project achieved its primary objectives, significant challenges and areas for improvement were identified through peer discussion and a deeper review of requirements.

      <h2>What I've Learned Since Mid-Semester</h2>
      <p>
        The mid-term project emphasized the importance of structuring tasks into clear, manageable components. Developing a database of at least 50 books and implementing features such as book availability tracking and rating analysis required a thorough understanding of data structures. The use of lists and dictionaries provided the basis for efficient data organization, while statistical concepts such as calculating the median emphasized the need for precision in coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        One aspect that worked particularly well was dividing students into groups based on the list of classes provided. Using an Excel file to organize the groups simplified the process and allowed clarity when assigning books. Additionally, the feature for identifying books that were borrowed and available was straightforward and worked reliably.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the project was not without problems. Dynamically and fairly assigning books to groups turned out to be more difficult than expected. Ensuring an accurate calculation of the average rating required careful handling of the data to avoid errors, particularly with odd or even accounting numbers. Another challenge was user input handling, as invalid inputs had to be handled gracefully to ensure a smooth experience. These difficulties highlighted the importance of thorough testing and robust error handling.
